<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I am very interested in both Computer Science and Astronomy Outreach, and see myself combining them into every step of my career path.
	<br/>
	I am currently working in IT at Five Colleges, Inc. on the Blended Learning project, which is incorporating technology into professors' classrooms.I really enjoy web development, and I have significant experience with Drupal, HTML (and HTML5), PHP, and CSS, as well as some experience with WordPress and JavaScript. 
<br/>I am very passionate about making the sites I work on completely accessible to all users. In addition, I am developing an interactive website for accessibility education, as I have noticed that many accessibility trainings would be much more effective if they were also interactive. <br/>
I am also very interested in astronomy and public outreach. The Pop-Up Astronomy exhibit (featured in the <a href="projects.php">projects section</a>) is my way of keeping that interest of mine going.</p>
