<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>I'm currently working in IT at Five Colleges, Inc. on the Blended Learning project - incorporating technology into professors' classrooms. One of my main job functions is being the project lead for LangMedia, a website by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages that provides videos, audios, and other content to help people who want to learn less-commonly-taught languages. We are adding sections that used to be static HTML content to the new dynamic Drupal site. <br/>
I really enjoy web development, and I have significant experience with Drupal, HTML (and HTML5), PHP, and CSS, as well as some experience with WordPress and JavaScript. I am very passionate about making the sites I work on completely accessible to all users. In addition, I am developing an interactive website for accessibility education, as I have noticed that many accessibility trainings would be much more effective if they were also interactive. <br/>
I am also very interested in astronomy and public outreach. The Pop-Up Astronomy exhibit (featured in the <a href="#projects">projects section</a> below) is my way of incorporating that into my life now, even though it's not my main job.</p>

		<h3> Pop-Up Astronomy </h3>
		<p><a href="assets/farmers-market-full.png"><img src="assets/farmers-market.png" width="100%" alt="The Pop-Up Astronomy table at the Farmers' Market." /></a>I created and designed an interactive exhibit featuring solar observing and hands-on activities to spark curiosity and encourage a lifelong love of astronomy. Along with Elena Marione, I present at the Amherst Farmers' Market every weekend and am hoping to expand in the future.</p>

		<p>This page accompanies the Pop-Up Astronomy Exhibit. It has further information about the project as well as the scientific background of the exhibits. The site is built on Wordpress, where I did some custom theming and wrote the content. </p>

		<h3> A11y </h3>
		<p>I am currently developing an interactive site for accessibility education. I'm using the LMS Opigno, which is built on Drupal. As part of this project, I am developing a new Drupal module, theming the site, and submitting issues on <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org">drupal.org</a> related to improving the accessibility of Drupal and Opigno. </p>

		<p><img src="assets/ast-341.png" width="100%" alt="Poster presented at Five College Astronomy Department"/> We began with an observing run at Kitt Peak National Observatory. My partner and I used our data for research into the reasons for recent star formation in certain Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies. At the end of the semester, we presented a poster to the Five College Astronomy Department.</p>
