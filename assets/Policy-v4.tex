\section{Introduction}
Smith College is well known for its historic beautiful residential campus and natural New England setting. 
Redesigned by the firm founded by Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. in 1893, the campus was planned so that students would follow curving, organic paths on their way to class and enjoy the natural and architectural beauty around them. When the campus was designed, the only artificial light at night was the occasional gas lamp. All campus residents knew the naturally dark night sky and the splendors of the Milky Way. Not until nearly fifty years later were outdoor electric lights installed around campus. 

Now, outdoor lighting at Smith is an often overlooked but very important facet of the college.
It is safe to assume that the college will have outdoor lighting for the foreseeable future. However, excessive or poorly designed outdoor lighting has negative effects on safety, human health, and the environment. Bright lights with high glare make it hard to see potential intruders or pedestrians crossing the street at night. Artificial light at night also has been correlated with higher risk for cancer, obesity, diabetes, and disruption of circadian rhythms, or sleep cycles. It disrupts many factors of the environment including both plants and animals. Finally, artificial skyglow created by this light obscures the starry night sky, impacting the ability to do meaningful research. 
It is these hazards that motivate the creation of this policy. 

This policy is focused on establishing safe, energy-efficient and dark-sky-friendly lighting at Smith College. It applies to all new construction on campus as well as replacements for existing light fixtures.

\section{Underlying Principles}

Design of outdoor lighting at Smith should take the following principles into consideration:
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety for all members of campus community, especially pedestrians and drivers
\item Public health (sleep cycles, reduction of risks for cancer and other diseases) 
\item Respect for the environment
\item Preserving the view of the natural starry sky
\item Historic and aesthetic tradition
\item Energy efficiency 
\item Northampton's outdoor lighting code
\end{itemize}


\section{Current Best Practices}
Lighting and light pollution are an increasing problem worldwide. The new advent of cheap, efficient LED lighting especially has spawned a jump to a 6\% increase (worsening) in light pollution per year. 
College and university campuses offer unique opportunities to combat light pollution: their institutional scale is often a manageable size for effecting change, they provide an opportunity to teach large numbers of students about these important issues, and many have active research in astronomy. Many of these campuses in the United States are currently grappling with this problem as well and starting to take steps to reduce their light pollution impact. 

The following colleges and universities are some good examples of institutions that have carefully controlled outdoor campus lighting.
\begin{itemize}
\item Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT
\begin{itemize}
\item Wesleyan has had an ongoing program to reduce light pollution on campus since 1980. 
\end{itemize}
\item Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ
\begin{itemize}
\item In 2010, NAU created a new lighting master plan to make their system comply with the Flagstaff Outdoor Lighting Code and unify the campus aesthetic. Among other changes, all fixtures were replaced with full cutoff lights.
\item Flagstaff, Arizona was the first internationally recognized Dark Sky City, meaning that it has shown dedication to the reduction of light pollution including lighting codes and education programs. 
\end{itemize}
\item Unity College, Unity, ME
\begin{itemize}
\item In 2015, Unity College designed all light fixtures for new construction to reduce and eliminate light pollution. 
\end{itemize}
\item Plymouth State University, Plymouth, NH
\begin{itemize}
\item In 2010, PSU made their outdoor lighting more energy efficient and implemented measures such as motion sensors and shields.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Existing Conditions at Smith College}
Outdoor lighting at Smith has evolved over the last century in an ad hoc and organic fashion. There is a very large range of style, brightness, protection against glare, color, and type of light sources. Outdoor light fixtures can be divided into two categories - free-standing and mounted on buildings. Mounted lights include wall packs, beacons, and entrance lights. 
Wall packs are lights that are attached to the sides of buildings that radiate light out in nearly every direction. An example is shown in Figure \ref{wallpack}.
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{wallpack.jpeg}
	\caption[Wall pack light]{Example of a wall pack light on the side of 10 Prospect Street}
	\label{wallpack}
\end{figure}
Beacons are the decorative light fixtures outside buildings like Neilson Library and Seelye Hall that are meant to serve as attractive signposts for the building. An example is shown in Figure \ref{beacon}.
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{beacon.jpeg}
	\caption[Beacon light]{Example of a beacon on the side of Burton Hall}
	\label{beacon}
\end{figure}
There are other entrance lights on every building on campus that range widely in style and type.

A recent study conducted by Gary Hartwell of Facilities Management mapped and tabulated most free-standing outdoor lights on campus, which fell into roughly six categories (Figure \ref{campus survey}).
 \begin{figure}[p]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{campussurvey.pdf}
	\caption[Campus lighting survey]{Campus lighting survey (Gary Hartwell, 2014)}
	\label{campus survey}
\end{figure}
The campus walkways are mostly illuminated by Sternberg inverted gooseneck lamps, such as the one shown in Figure \ref{gooseneck}.
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{Gooseneck.png}
	\caption[Gooseneck light]{An example of a Sternberg inverted gooseneck fixture.}
	\label{gooseneck}
\end{figure}
Currently, when lightbulbs fail, there are a mix of different bulbs that are being used to replace them. In addition, new fixture styles are being used for each new project. 
There are semiannual lighting walks conducted by the Dean of Students to evaluate the condition of the lights and note where lights need to be replaced. The walks are attended by representatives of student government and of the houses, Public Safety, and Facilities Management.

Here we list several examples of well-designed and poorly designed outdoor lighting fixtures at Smith.
\subsection{Well-designed light fixtures}
A good lighting fixture can be found on the back wall of Burton Hall - the light is directed only downwards, not out or up (Figure \ref{burtongood}).
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{BurtonGood.png}
	\caption[Light on Burton Hall]{Well-designed fixture on the back wall of Burton Hall}
	\label{burtongood}
\end{figure}
Another good fixture is found on the entrance to the Lyman Plant House. This light is fully shielded so that it is very efficiently lighting the ground but nowhere else (Figure \ref{Lyman}).
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{Lyman.jpg}
	\caption[Light on Lyman Plant House]{Well-designed fixture at the entrance of the Lyman Plant House}
	\label{Lyman}
\end{figure}
There are many well-designed Sternberg gooseneck fixtures around campus, specifically those which are completely shielded and have no bulb emerging from the bottom (Figure \ref{gooseneck}).
\subsection{Poorly-designed light fixtures}
One example of bad lighting fixtures at Smith is at the Mendenhall Performing Arts Center. These fixtures radiate light out in every direction, which is highly inefficient and visually uncomfortable, as shown in Figure \ref{Mendenhall}.
\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{mendenhall.jpg}
	\caption[Mendenhall Performing Arts Center lighting]{The lights surrounding Mendenhall Performing Arts Center let light radiate out in all directions, including up into the sky and into peoples' eyes. This is both highly inefficient and uncomfortable to look at.}
	\label{Mendenhall}
\end{figure}  
Another example of poorly designed fixtures are the Bollard lights outside of the Campus Center, which are lights on low posts that also radiate in every direction (Figure \ref{Bollard}).
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{CCBollard.png}
	\caption[Light outside of Campus Center]{Poorly-designed fixture outside of the Campus Center.}
	\label{Bollard}
\end{figure}
On the back of Ziskind House there is a light that is well-shielded against light going directly up, but very poorly shielded against glare (Figure \ref{CZbad}).
 \begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{CZBad2.png}
	\caption[Light on Ziskind House]{Poorly-designed fixture on the back of Ziskind House.}
	\label{CZbad}
\end{figure}

\section{Quantitative Assessment of Outdoor Lighting}
The Backlight Uplight Glare (BUG) light rating system was developed by the IES to quantify the amount and direction in which light is emitted by a given light fixture. Each element of the BUG rating is categorized from 0 to 5, with 0 being the least light emitted in a given direction and 5 being the most (Tables \ref{BUp2}, \ref{BUGlare2}, and \ref{Back}). Figure \ref{BUG3D} shows the angles of light that the BUG system regulates.
\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{BUG3D.png}
	\caption[BUG 3D diagram]{The IES separates the solid angle of light into different regulated sections.}
	\label{BUG3D}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{uplight.jpg}
	\caption[BUG uplighting solid angles]{The IES separates the solid angle of light into sections. Each of these sections is allowed to emit only a specific number of lumens in order to receive a low BUG rating, as shown in figure \ref{BUp2}.}
	\label{BUp}
\end{figure}
\begin{table}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{uprate.jpg}
	\caption[BUG uplighting rating table]{The amount of lumens allowed in each solid angle - Uplight High (UH), Uplight Low (UL), Front Very High (FVH), and Back Very High (BVH). This regulates the total amount of light emitted above 80\degree from vertical.}

\end{table}

	\caption[BUG glare rating table]{The amount of lumens allowed in each solid angle - Front Very High (FVH), Back Very High (BVH), Front High (FH), and Back High (BH). This regulates the total amount of light emitted between 60\degree and 90\degree from the nadir.}

\end{table}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{backrate.jpg}
	\caption[BUG backlighting rating table]{The amount of lumens allowed in each solid angle - Back High (BH), Back Medium (BM), and Back Low (BL). This regulates the total amount of light emitted between 90\degree and 270\degree from the front of the fixture.}
	\label{Back}
\end{table}

Another quantitative assessment of lighting fixtures is through the Correlated Color Temperature(CCT) of the bulb. This is a number assigned to the bulb based on the color of the light it emits. These colors correlate to the color of a metal that is heated to a specific temperature. Older light bulbs have metal filaments that actually reach this temperature, while more modern elements do not, but still retain the CCT as a way of describing the color.

%mention brightness on the ground
%then brightness on the sky
%throw in a figure about measures of sky brightness - the one with all the different ratings - include zoom in of sky brightness of Northampton
%potentially include here that the Astronomy department has longitudinal data about sky brightness - later then be able to say that we can't make the skyglow worse
%be able to say that typical sky brightnesses at McConnell before + after LEDs in Noho are about 19.5 mag/arcsec2 ~~7 times brighter than the natural sky


\section{Policy}
The following policy is informed by best practices on outdoor lighting set forth by the Illumination Engineers Society (IES), lighting designers, and the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA). The following four rules are the proposed policies for Smith College Outdoor Lighting. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lights should be fully shielded against glare, uplighting, and backlighting.
\begin{itemize}
\item Lights should have a BUG uplighting rating of U0 (Figure \ref{BUp}, Table \ref{BUp2}). The light is fully cut off and never escapes upward out of the fixture. 
\item Lights should have a BUG glare rating of G0, or at most G1 (Figure \ref{BUGlare}, Table \ref{BUGlare2}). Ideally, light should be cast downward in a cone extending no more than 60 degrees from vertical. The light source itself is not directly visible unless one is standing directly underneath the fixture.
\item Outdoor lighting should not shine into dorm rooms or other buildings. This includes a BUG Backlight rating of B0, (Figure \ref{BUGlare:back}, Table \ref{Back}).
\end{itemize}
\item Outdoor lights should be as bright as is needed for safety, but no brighter. Excessive light can lead to glare and impair rather than enhance safety. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The IES has published minimum recommended levels. 
It is important to not that these levels are recommendations only and are not prescribed by any existing law or building code. Furthermore, they do not specify a maximum light level. Lights should be no more than 10\% brighter than their minimum recommendation.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Lighting Levels}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\item Illumination levels on the ground directly underneath lighting fixtures should be no more than 1 foot-candle. If glare is well-controlled, levels of 0.5 foot-candles underneath walkway lights is the recommended target.
\item No specific minimum or maximum uniformity ratios are recommended. In general, better visibility is provided by higher contrast on the ground.

\end{itemize}
\item Lights should not be too blue in color.
\begin{itemize}
\item The lights should have a correlated color temperature (CCT) in the range 1800-2700K, and no more than 3000K.
\end{itemize}
\item Whenever available, the college should take advantage of the ability to dim or extinguish lights late at night, especially in less trafficked areas.
\begin{itemize}
\item One of the major benefits of LED lights is that they can be dimmed easily as long as that option is included when they are installed. 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample Approved Fixtures}
\subsection{Freestanding Fixtures}
%\subsubsection{Fixtures for New Construction}
%\subsubsection{Retrofit/Replacement Fixtures}
A replacement for a Bollard-style fixture is the Ashbery Path Light, produced by LandscapeForms (Figure \ref{Ashbury}). This shields the light against glare and has a color temperature of 3000K.
\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Ashbery_PathLight-09_main.jpg}
	\caption[Ashbery Path Light]{Ashbery Path Light from LandscapeForms}
	\label{Ashbury}
\end{figure}
The Sternberg gooseneck fixtures around campus are another good example. For these, there is an XXX incandescent model with a recessed bulb that can be replaced by a LED so there is a fully shielded bulb with a lower correlated color temperature and more efficiency. 
\subsection{Attached Fixtures}
One wall pack that is approved is the Voltaire Architectural Wall Pack produced by H.E. Williams, Inc. (Figure \ref{Voltaire}). This is fully shielded and has factory set automatic dimming controls.
\begin{figure}[p]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Wallpack.jpg}
	\caption[Voltaire Architectural Wall Pack]{Voltaire Architectural Wall Pack from H.E. Williams, Inc.}
	\label{Voltaire}
\end{figure}
A good retrofit is to put a can-like shield around an existing fixture. These shields also exist on new fixtures. One such fixture is the Skyline Light Wall Mount from Minka Group (Figure \ref{lightinacan}).
\begin{figure}[p]

%note that this needs to be followed up on - look at BUG ratings
%include many styles, go as old-fashioned as possible, include very different/discrete styles - showing that can be consistent with dark sky and good requirements
