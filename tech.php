	<h3 id="lang">Post-Baccalaureate Web Technologist for Blended Learning</h3>
	<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://fivecolleges.edu">Five Colleges, Inc.</a>; July 2017 - Present</h4>
	<p> One of my main job functions is being the project lead for LangMedia, a website by the Five College Center for the Study of World Languages that provides videos, audios, and other content to help people who want to learn less-commonly-taught languages. We are adding sections that used to be static HTML content to the new dynamic Drupal site. I am also working with a team creating an <a target="_blank" href="http://omeka.org/s">Omeka S</a> repository for Blended Learning materials. Other duties included assisting in the hiring process for student workers, including conducting interviews and checking references, and creating <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hzjEkMUuiG8">a short video</a> using Adobe Premiere to help Five College students feel comfortable on the local bus system.</p>
	<h3>STRIDE Research Assistant</h3>
	<h4> <a target="_blank" href="http://smith.edu">Smith College</a>; August 2013 - May 2015</h4>
	<p>I recieved the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/applied-learning-research/stride-program">STRIDE scholarship</a> from Smith, which was accompanied by an internship opportunity for my first two years of college. I worked with Professor Albert Mosley, formatting online exercises for a logic textbook and creating a website for the textbook. I also assisted in a class's implementation and use of the website. I presented my work at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/college-events/celebrating-collaborations">Smith College Celebrating Collaborations</a> both academic years.</p>
