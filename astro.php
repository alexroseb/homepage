	<h3><a href="http://astro.alexroseb.com">Pop-Up Astronomy</a></h3>
	<h4>April 2018 - Present</h4>
	<p> Pop-Up Astronomy was born from a desire to incorporate astronomy outreach into my current life, outside of my day job. It is an interactive exhibit that is presented at the Amherst Farmers' Market every weekend, featuring solar observing and hands-on activities. I created and designed the exhibit, and am collaborating with Elena Marione on the presentations and further development. We are hoping to expand in the future to activities like school visits and a monthly astronomy adventure club.</p>
	<h3>Museum Assistant</h3>
	<h4> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/">Emily Dickinson Museum</a>; October 2017 - Present</h4>
	<p>I assist with daily museum operations such as answering guest questions about museum information. I also enjoy giving an adjusted version of our tour to guests with mobility issues.</p>
	<h3>Astronomy General Teaching Assistant</h3>
	<h4> <a target="_blank" href="http://smith.edu">Smith College</a>; January 2016 - May 2017</h4>I helped the department lab professor during classes and supervised labs. Outside of class, I had office hours assisting students with making up assignments and understanding class materials.</p>
	<h3>Astronomy Program Intern</h3>
	<h4> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.outdoors.org/">Appalachian Mountain Club</a>; May 2016 - August 2016</h4>
	<p>Over the summer, I did an internship for astronomy public outreach at a hiking lodge. I set up telescopes for solar and night observation and led astronomy programs for the general public as well as youth camp groups.</p>
