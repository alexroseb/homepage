		<h3> Pop-Up Astronomy </h3>
		<a href="assets/farmers-market-full.png" class="projectls"><figure><img src="assets/farmers-market.png" width="100%" alt=""/><figcaption>The Pop-Up Astronomy table at the Farmers' Market.</figcaption></figure></a>
		<p>I created and designed an interactive exhibit featuring solar observing and hands-on activities to spark curiosity and encourage a lifelong love of astronomy. Along with Elena Marione, I present at the Amherst Farmers' Market every weekend and am hoping to expand in the future. I also created <a href="http://astro.alexroseb.com">a website to accompany the Pop-Up Astronomy Exhibit</a>. It has further information about the project as well as the scientific background of the exhibits. The site is built on Wordpress, where I did some custom theming and wrote the content. <a href="http://astro.alexroseb.com">Learn more about Pop-Up Astronomy. </a></p>

		<h3> A11y </h3>
		<p>I am currently developing an interactive site for accessibility education. I'm using the LMS Opigno, which is built on Drupal. As part of this project, I am developing a new Drupal module, theming the site, and submitting issues on <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org">drupal.org</a> related to improving the accessibility of Drupal and Opigno. <a href="https://github.com/alexroseb/opigno-a11y" target="_blank">View the GitHub repository for A11y.</a></p>
